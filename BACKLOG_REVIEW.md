# Backlog Review (SOW vs Repo)

This document maps SOW milestones to current repo features and identifies gaps.

## SOW Milestone Coverage

- Phase 0 (Kickoff): docs added; access owners and validation pending.
- Phase 1 (Foundation): auth/RLS/migrations exist; deployment validation pending.
- Phase 2 (Core CRM): customers, inquiries, service history exist; customer notes/log missing.
- Phase 3 (Scheduling/Routing): routes, schedule board, optimization exist.
- Phase 4 (Billing/Integrations): Stripe + Google Sheets exist; audit logs missing.
- Phase 5 (Analytics/Reporting): analytics dashboard exists; exportable reports missing.
- Phase 6 (Hardening/Launch): docs added; security/perf review + UAT pending.

## Proposed Priorities (Confirm)

1. Customer notes/communication log (Phase 2 gap).
2. Audit logs (Phase 4 gap).
3. Analytics exports (Phase 5 gap).
4. Security/performance review artifacts (Phase 6 gap).
