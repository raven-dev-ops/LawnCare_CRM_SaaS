- Validate Stripe webhook flow in production and confirm invoice updates
- Confirm inquiry SLA workflow (assign ownership, response tracking)
- Harden Google Maps API keys and billing alerts
- Document onboarding checklist for new admin users

## 30-90 Days (Operational Efficiency)
- Route planning UI improvements (drag-and-drop ordering, map editing)
- Weekly schedule enhancements and bulk status updates
- Crew assignment view with quick status toggles
- Improved analytics for revenue, route efficiency, and inquiry sources

## 90-180 Days (Growth and Retention)
- Customer portal for invoices, service history, and payments
- Automated email/SMS reminders for upcoming service and past-due invoices
